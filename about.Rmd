  Hello! My name is Sam. I'm currently a Data Analyst and Computer Science Student (MCS-DS). 
  Visit my Github Pages site for my public [projects](https://parmsam.github.io/projects.html) or [Github](https://github.com/parmsam) for code I've used.
  <br><br>
  This blog is meant to share my thoughts, my work, or some things I've learned along the way. Hope you enjoy and learn something new.
  <br><br>
  Most posts will also be published on my Medium account [here](https://parmsam.medium.com/).
